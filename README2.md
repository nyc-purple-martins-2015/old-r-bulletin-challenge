# Test-me: Add some tests and refactor

Senior enginner Steven Harms has written a starter implementation of the first three releases of our r-bulletin app. Now our boss wants us to add some tests to the application before she'll let us loose on it (she naturally doesn't trust us to start making changes without some assurance that we won't break the app in doing so.)

Our job for the remainder of the day is to add appropriate tests for the existing app functionality. We'll want to have close to 100% test coverage. Then we can start (if there's time) adding the functionality listed.

###R3
Convert the add messages and start conversations functionality to use ajax

###R4
* As a logged in user, I want to like user messages.
* As a logged in user, I should only be able to like a message once.
* As a logged in user, I should be able to see a list of my likes.
* As a visitor viewing a conversation, I should see the like count on each message.
